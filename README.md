# Statistical-analysis-using-R


## The Project

Here are some statistical analyses I made during my studies at DSTI, using R Markdown / LaTeX notebooks.

Following analysis were performed:
* Linear model: building a model, checking assumptions on the noise and comparing several methods of variable selection
* Distribution fitting and point estimation: Fitting of an exponential distribution and estimation of lambda parameter, with several methods
* Confidence interval computing: I built a ready to use notebook to compute confidence intervals (mean, sd, %) from a dataset
* Time series analysis: I compared several models to predict power consumption of a building, using a time series dataset 



## Datasets
Following datasets were used. some of them are commonly used in education, some other were found on Kaggle.
* Data1.txt (Distribution fitting) : set of time arrival between several points
* ukcomp1_r.dat (Linear model): training set
* ukcomp2_r.dat (Linear model): testing set
* Elec-train.csv (Time series analysis): building power consumption dataset



## Technologies & languages 

* [R studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) - IDE for R programming language
* [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) - Notebook format for R
* [LaTeX]() - Document preparation system for high-quality typesetting
